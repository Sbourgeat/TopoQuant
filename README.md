# TopoQuant

## What is it?

TopoQuant is a pastime project I am making to explore and find intersections
between two things I really like: Topology and Quantitative finance.
The main idea is to for me to see how Topological Data Analysis can be used to make predictions in finance.
I am aware similar approaches were probably already taken. My goal is not to make the next Python Quant library
but rather just explore some ideas.

# Awesome TDA and time-series libraries
